# Gamuda Flutter App (Assignment)

## Pre-requisites

This frontend is to be paired with the [Gamuda Flutter App Backend](https://github.com/HJWongAtWork/gamuda_flutter_backend_final), which provides the database for authentications and data behind the chart displays. Please follow the instructions there on setup BEFORE USING THE WEB APP.

## Overview

This is a Flutter Web App demo as per a personal assignment. The app is currently hosted on [Firebase](https://gamuda-flutter-homework-01.web.app/), but will be taken down in the near future.

The project is intended to display:

- The use of Flutter, in this case a Web app demonstration
- The use of different authentication methods, one being the local method, and the other being Google Authentication (however, it is a test app, and logins may be restricted unless your Google Account is listed as a test user)
- The use of Firebase and CICD via GitHub Workflows
- The application of three different Flutter charts upon login, as well as basic profile management

Please feel free to build upon this, the basic commands being:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run # For development

flutter build web # To build a production Web app
```
